## Objective

Build a full-stack calculator application with a React frontend and a backend
microservice. The frontend should consume the backend API to perform basic and
advanced arithmetic operations. Focus on clean design, maintainable code, and
testable architecture.

## Requirements

- **Functional Operations:**
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
  - Optional: Exponentiation, Square Root, Percentage
- **Frontend (React):**
  - Intuitive UI for entering input and displaying results
  - Input validation and error handling
  - Responsive design (basic mobile support)
- **Backend (REST API):**
  - Expose endpoints for calculator operations
  - Validate input and handle edge cases (division by zero, invalid data)
  - Return results in JSON format
- **Non-Functional**
  - Clean, readable, and idiomatic code (frontend and backend)
  - Unit tests covering key functionality for both layers
  - Documentation: setup instructions, API usage, and design rationale
  - Optional: Dockerfile for full-stack deployment

## Constraints

- Frontend: React (TypeScript preferred)
- Backend: Go is preferred

## Deliverables

- Git repository with frontend and backend code
- README with setup instructions, API examples, and design decisions
- Unit tests and coverage report
- Optional: Dockerfile to run frontend + backend together

## Instructions

- Use any AI tooling you would like
- Spend ~2–4 hours on this assignment. Prioritize correctness, clarity, and
  maintainability over extra features.
- Push your solution to GitHub, GitLab, or another Git repository.
- Share the repository link with us for evaluation.
- Share any prompts that you used in your work
- Make sure your README includes:
  - Setup instructions
  - How to run the frontend and backend
  - Examples of API calls (if using REST)
  - Design decisions or assumptions
